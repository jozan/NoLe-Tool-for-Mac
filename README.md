# NoLe Tool (NordicLeague Tool)
A helper tool for Nordic League Mac users written in Objective-C.

**NoLe Tool includes the following features:**
- Automatic updates
- Automatic game name copy to clipboard
- Displays and updates automatically correct number of players currently in lobby
- Global hotkey (CTRL+ALT+CMD+SPACE) to speak the player count using built-in speech syntesizer with default voice


This is our free time project to learn Cocoa/Objective-C programming and on the side of that produce a working Mac application for our relatively small DotA league (http://www.nordicleague.eu).
